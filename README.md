## Understanding Git and GitHub

### Git

- **Core Platform:** Utilize Git for committing changes, checking status, and creating repositories.
- **Branching:** Facilitate collaborative work through the creation of multiple branches, allowing for parallel development.
- **Merging:** Combine branches into a master or main branch for cohesive project management.
- **Submodules:** Leverage Git submodules to incorporate and track a separate repository within a parent repository, ideal for including external libraries or plugins.

### GitHub

- **Version Control:** Built on Git, GitHub provides a collaborative platform that tracks file changes over time, enabling teamwork without conflicts.
- **Repositories:** Host your project files in repositories, which can be either public or private, encompassing all project files and their change history.
- **Branches & Commits:** Work on different project versions simultaneously with branches. Save changes using commits, each with a unique ID for easy change tracking.
- **Collaboration Tools:** GitHub enhances team collaboration through pull requests, forks, issues tracking, project boards, wikis, and discussions.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** Automate workflows within your GitHub repository for continuous integration and deployment, testing, and more.
- **GitHub Pages:** Host websites directly from GitHub repositories, useful for project documentation or personal portfolios.
